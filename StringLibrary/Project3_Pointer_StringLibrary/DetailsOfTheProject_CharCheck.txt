							ALWAYS CODE DEFENSIVELY.............................
Checking character is present in the given string
2) char* stringCheck(const char* stringValue,int value);
	a) Function will return where character "<a>" is present in the stringValue
		Address will be returned.
	b) Characters are integers at heart.
	   Interger are just the ASCII Code for the character.
	   ASCII Character are integers i.e. A = 65, a = 97 etc.
	   So we can use them for comparing the characters
3) Below is the PSEUDOCODE for if string is present inside the given string
	1) Add NULL check on const character pointer inside the function.
	2) Assign the const character pointer to another character pointer.
	3) Add a loop to go through all the characters within this character pointer.
	4) Add if clause inside the loop to compare it character by character
	   with character pointer and value to be checked.
	5) Return a casted character pointer. 
	6) Use post-Increment on character pointer - (Arithematic pointer will do its job)
	7) Outside loop if comparision fails then return NULL value.
